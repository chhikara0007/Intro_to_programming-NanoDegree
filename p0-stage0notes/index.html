    <h1>Important Concepts</h1>
    <b>How the Web Works</b>
    <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
    with each other. When a person goes to a web
    page like www.google.com, their computer sends
    a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
    server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
    it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
    interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

    does a good job of explaining.

    <b>HTML</b>
    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
      content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
      and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".<em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> is the language of the internet.
      HTML is interpreted by a computer's browser.These documents reside on servers. When a user accesses a webpage their computer sends an <b>HTTP</b> request to the server.
      The server finds the document and sends it across the internet where it is interpreted by the user's browser.
      The web is a collection of HTML documents. There are approximately 30 billion pages on the World Wide Web.
      <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340"> This
      video</a> gives a good overview.

    <b>Tags and Elements</b>
    <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
      writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.Some of the tags are &lt;a&gt; tag, &lt;img&gt; tag, &lt;b&gt; tag etc.

      explains the distinction well.
    </p>

    <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
    <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
      literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
      small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
      in a program. they do whatever we make them to do. They just follows the instructions given to them.
    </p>

    <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
    <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
      elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
      them. some of the inline elements are &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;span&gt; etc.
      Example of block elements are &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;form&gt; etc.
